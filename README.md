# Pixel-Project

Well, this was made for fun.
Basically, Pixel Project was a interactable grid where you can paint that we made in our school, but I took it a bit too seriously
And yes, I'm aware that the code may be shit and I have a LOT to improve, but I don't think I'll update this project too much for now. So, if someone is even seeing this in first place, thank you for the attention.
